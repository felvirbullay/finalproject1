    <p>
        Ferdinand "Bongbong" Romualdez Marcos Jr. had not served as president of the Philippines, but he is a prominent figure in Philippine politics, being the son of former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and former First Lady Imelda Marcos. Bongbong Marcos has held various political positions, including serving as a member of the House of Representatives and as a Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was born on September 13, 1957, in Manila, Philippines. He is the second child of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and Imelda Marcos. His family's political dynasty has played a significant role in Philippine history, with his father serving as President from 1965 to 1986.
    </p>
    <p>
        He entered politics in the late 1980s, following the ousting of his father's regime during the 1986 People Power Revolution. Despite the controversies surrounding his family's legacy, he pursued a political career, aiming to continue the Marcos name in public service.
    </p>
    <p>
        He served as Governor of Ilocos Norte from 1998 to 2007, where he focused on infrastructure development and social welfare programs. Marcos then transitioned to national politics, serving as a member of the House of Representatives from 2007 to 2010, representing the 2nd district of Ilocos Norte.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2010, Marcos was elected as a Senator of the Philippines, where he served until 2016. During his tenure as Senator, he focused on various legislative initiatives, including advocating for electoral reform and promoting regional development.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Throughout his political career, Bongbong Marcos has maintained a loyal following, particularly in his family's stronghold of Ilocos Norte. He has expressed ambitions for higher political office, including running for Vice President in the 2016 Philippine presidential election, where he narrowly lost to Leni Robredo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the current president's contributions are still coming and lets just hope that those plans of his can improve this country of ours.
