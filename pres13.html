    <p>
        Joseph "Erap" Ejercito Estrada was born on April 19, 1937, in Tondo, Manila, Philippines. He began his career as a popular film actor before venturing into politics. In 1969, he entered public service as the Mayor of San Juan, a position he held until 1986. During his tenure, he implemented various social programs and infrastructure projects that endeared him to the masses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Estrada's political career reached its peak when he was elected Vice President of the Philippines in 1992 under President Fidel V. Ramos. In 1998, he won the presidency by a landslide victory, running on a platform that focused on addressing poverty and inequality in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
        During his presidency, Estrada introduced several initiatives aimed at improving the lives of the poor and marginalized. These included:
    </p>
    <p>
        1.Economic Policies: Estrada implemented pro-poor economic policies, including programs to support small-scale entrepreneurs and farmers. He also advocated for increased government spending on social services and infrastructure development.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.Social Welfare Programs: One of Estrada's key priorities was the expansion of social welfare programs, such as healthcare and education assistance for low-income families. He also supported initiatives to provide housing for the homeless and landless.
    </p>    
    <p>
        3.Peace and Order: Estrada launched campaigns to combat crime and corruption, including efforts to strengthen law enforcement and improve the judicial system. However, his administration was also criticized for human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Infrastructure Development: Under Estrada's leadership, significant investments were made in infrastructure projects, including the construction of roads, bridges, and public buildings. These projects aimed to stimulate economic growth and improve access to basic services for all Filipinos.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Despite his efforts to improve the country's socio-economic conditions, Estrada's presidency was marred by allegations of corruption and incompetence. In 2001, he was impeached by the Philippine Congress on charges of bribery, graft, and plunder.
