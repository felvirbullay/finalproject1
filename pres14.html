        Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, born on April 5, 1947, in San Juan, Metro Manila, Philippines, is a prominent figure in Philippine politics, serving as the 14th President of the Philippines from 2001 to 2010. Her life and political career are marked by a blend of academic excellence, public service, and controversies.

        Arroyo hails from a distinguished political family. Her father, Diosdado Macapagal, served as the ninth President of the Philippines.

        In 2001, Arroyo assumed the presidency following the ousting of President Joseph Estrada amid allegations of corruption. During her presidency, she implemented various policies and initiatives aimed at addressing the country's economic challenges and promoting social development. Among her notable contributions and actions during her presidency are:

        1.Economic Reforms: Arroyo pursued economic reforms to stabilize the Philippine economy and promote growth. She implemented fiscal austerity measures, including tax reforms and debt management strategies, to address budget deficits and attract foreign investments.
